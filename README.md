- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @T-Erickson

I am currently learning Python and have started my coding journey in Spring of 2023. I currently work as a real estate appraiser, but it isn't my passion.
I've always wanted to learn how to code in order to develop my own apps and programs, even if they are small and intended for specific tasks. 

I would be more than happy to contribute to a project, let me know what you have! 

Thanks!
